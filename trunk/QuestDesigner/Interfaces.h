	Buffers can chenge as the device that created them die or is changed. So a method 
	to invalidate the buffer is provided. The device that created the buffer must check

	checking if the buffer's device ID is the same as the current device ID. In case 
	the buffer is not valid or its device is different from the current active device, 
	a new buffer should be created.

	Buffers generally contain cached data related to how an object is drawn on the 
	screen, so buffers should be invalidated every time an object changes, to reflect
	its changes at the rendering time.

	Many classes are needed to maintain control of their lives. This interface
	creates classes that need to have a life span control. This is handled using
