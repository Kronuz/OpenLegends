	\brief		Interface of the classes that maintain sprites properties.
	\date		April 15, 2003

	All sprites are almost the same, but to distinguish sprites that
	can handle an advanced interaction (entities) from those which do not 
	(backgrounds), we are going to call Background Sprites to those objects that never move, 
	and that have no other purpose in the game other than to look nice 
	and occupy a space in the world (some times a solid space). Background
	sprites must use Mask maps if they need some sort of collision 
	detection. An example of background sprites would be a flower, or a fence.
	
	Entities, on the other hand, are sprites that can maintain an advanced
	interaction with other entities. This advanced interaction is ruled by
	the entity's script file. An enemy or a chest are classic examples of 
	entities. Entities can have either of two methods for collision 
	detection: the use a mask map (as background sprites) or the use any
	of the collision detection functions inside its associated script.

	A mask map is a special type of sprite that it's attached to backgrounds or
	to some entities. Mask maps are not visible in the game, its functionality
	is more related to the behavior of other entities approaching to its parent
	background or entity. A mask map can be set to solidify objects or to make 
	objects  harder to penetrate. This is done using different colors, in the 
	mask, to map different grades of body solidification, matching the 
	areas of the background or entity sprite that need to be solidified. Using 
	different shades of red, the closer it gets to the red, the easier it's to 
	pass through. Solid red, howeve, only slows down any entity trying to cross 
	the mask, while green presents no obstacule at all, as if no mask map existed 
	in that zone)
