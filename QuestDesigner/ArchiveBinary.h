	\brief		Archive binary mode operations classes.
	\author		Kronuz
	\version	1.0
	\date		April 28, 2003

	ArchiveText.h provides the interfaces for reading and writing objects
	in text mode. Every object loaded or saved through this
	class is saved in the disk using a plain binary mode to accelerate
	saving/loading operations and save space.
	\sa ArchiveText.h.
	\todo Write the implementation of this class, also write a new class to
		manage compressed binary mode, saving on-disk space and reducing
		the number of needed files to one (probably zipped).
