	\brief		Interface of the CProjectManager class.
	\date		April 15, 2003

	This file defines the classes needed to handle the game project.
	The project manager is in charge of pretty much everything that has
	to do with the game. This includes the sounds, the sprites, the scripts,
	the saved files, the maps and the entities and its properties.

	The project manager makes use of several classes defined in four main
	modules: the File Manager, which is in charge of saving and loading the
	needed files for the project; the Sprite Manager, with the job of
	maintaining the sprites: entities, masks and backgrounds of the game, along
	with their properties; the Sound Manager, which maintains the full list of
	sounds used by the game; and a World Manager, which provides the necessary
	methods and structures to build the whole quest.
	
	CProjectManager is perhaps the most important module of all, since it 
	unites all other four modules into one working engine. Its functionality
	is implemented as an object factory, giving birth and controling life of 
	each object related to the game.
