<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
The CodeSense License Agreement describes the rights and responsibilities of application developers who wish to use the CodeSense control within their applications, as well as the conditions under which the control can be distributed.  It also describes the rights, responsibilities, and liabilities of the CodeSense control developer and maintainer, <a href="mailto:nlewis@programmer.net">Nathan Lewis</a>.
</p>

<p>
Before continuing, it is important to note that the CodeSense control is not a totally original work:  The bulk of the CodeSense control source code is derived from the CodeMax control sources made freely available by WinMain Software.  Only the so-called &quot;CodeList&quot; and &quot;CodeTip&quot; extensions to the original code sources are the original works of Nathan Lewis.  Therefore, the CodeSense control is distributed under two separate but related license agreements: The <a href="#CodeSense">CodeSense License Agreement</a> and the <a href="#CodeMax">CodeMax License Agreement</a>.

<b>Grant of License.</b>  WinMain Software grants a limited, non-exclusive license to use unlimited copies of the custom control called CodeMax for the purpose of developing applications for the Windows environment.

<p>
<b>Runtime Distribution License.</b>  WinMain Software grants you a royalty-free right to distribute copies of the runtime dynamic link libraries for use with applications you have developed using CodeMax.  CodeMax runtime files are listed in Exhibit A.  These libraries may not be distributed for any other purpose than to accompany software that you have developed using CodeMax.  You may use CodeMax in your specific purpose application programs, in which WinMain Software grants you permission under WinMain Software’s copyright to use, give away or sell such programs without additional licenses or fees, as long as all copies of these programs bear a valid copyright notice stating ‘<b>Portions Copyright 1997-2003 Barry Allyn.  All rights reserved.</b>’  If source code is recompiled, and then packaged with your application, the executeable file must be named differently than the files listed in Exhibit A (in order to prevent file version conflicts with other applications which use CodeMax).  This permission is granted solely for the purpose set forth above, and you are not authorized to use CodeMax in any other manner without written permission from WinMain Software.
