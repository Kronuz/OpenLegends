License Agreement
This is a legal agreement between you, the end user, and WinMain Software.  By using this software, you are agreeing to accept ownership of this product and to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  

WinMain Software License for CodeMax:

Grant of License.
WinMain Software grants a limited, non-exclusive license to use unlimited copies of the custom control called CodeMax for the purpose of developing applications for the Windows environment.

Runtime Distribution License.
WinMain Software grants you a royalty-free right to distribute copies of the runtime dynamic link libraries for use with applications you have developed using CodeMax.  CodeMax runtime files are listed in Exhibit A.  These libraries may not be distributed for any other purpose than to accompany software that you have developed using CodeMax.  You may use CodeMax in your specific purpose application programs, in which WinMain Software grants you permission under WinMain Software's copyright to use, give away or sell such programs without additional licenses or fees, as long as all copies of these programs bear a valid copyright notice stating 'Portions Copyright 1997-2000 Barry Allyn.  All rights reserved.'.  If source code is recompiled, and then packaged with your application, the executeable file must be named differently than the files listed in Exhibit A (in order to prevent file version conflicts with other applications which use CodeMax).  This permission is granted solely for the purpose set forth above, and you are not authorized to use CodeMax in any other manner without written permission from WinMain Software.

Copyright.
CodeMax is owned by WinMain Software and is protected by United States Copyright laws and international treaty provisions.

Other Restrictions.
You may not sell or profit from CodeMax as a separate, individually-installable component.  However, you may package CodeMax with an application which requires CodeMax in order to function properly.  In other words, only WinMain Software may profit from CodeMax.  CodeMax may not be bundled with a toolbox of ActiveX or DLL controls which are sold for a profit.
